				<h1>College Students Stress About Cost of Living Post-Graduation</h1>
				<h2> One in five students say affording life after college is one of their top stressors, according to a new survey. </h2>

				<p class="first-graph">Graduation season typically brings a feeling of jubilation, but with high cost of living and a competitive job market facing college graduates, students report feeling more anxious about their future prospects. A recent survey by <i> Inside Higher Ed </i> and Generation Lab found nearly one in five college students say their top stressor is affording life after graduation and similar numbers worry that they don’t have enough internship or work experience to be successful. 
					<br> 
					<br>
					The survey, fielded in August, includes over 5,000 responses from college students including 1,000 two-year college students and nearly 2,000 first-generation learners.

				<p>Christine Cruzvergara, job board Handshake’s chief education officer, said the trend doesn’t surprise her because it mirrors similar data Handshake collected earlier this year. 
					<br>
					<br>
					“Students are feeling pessimistic, and when we ask them why, there are a number of different factors, obviously the economy, what's happening in the federal government, but also AI,” Cruzvergara said. “It's a confluence of all of these things that is creating that concern.”

<br>
<br>
“I know no one is going to hire me in an economy like this,” one student at New Mexico State University-Dona Ana wrote in the “other” response option for the survey. 
<br>
<br>
Students’ perceived lack of skills and experience also points to a growing concern for higher education leaders to provide work-based learning to students to prepare them for the workforce. 
<br>
<br>
“We are seeing more institutions make experiential learning or internships a guarantee or part of their strategic plan,” Cruzvergara said. Four-year students are more likely to have graduated from high school and enrolled in college directly after, which could explain why this group of students is more likely to fret about their lack of work experience, Cruzvergara said. 
<br>
<br>
“Therefore, if they didn't do an internship, or they only did a part-time job in the summer, they might feel as if they're at a disadvantage because they haven't been in a more traditional white collar work environment,” Cruzvergara said.
